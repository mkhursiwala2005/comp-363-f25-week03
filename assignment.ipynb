    "The code below is based on the [work we did in the classroom](https://github.com/lgreco/comp-363-f25-live-coding/blob/main/week03/huffman.ipynb) this week. We are given a binary tree [`Node` object](./Node.py) and a few basic methods towards building a Huffman encoder/decoder. Your assignment is to complete the Huffman encoder/decoder according to the following specifications.\n",

    "- You may assume that the input message comprises only upper case and spaces. Method `filter_uppercase_and_spaces` can convert any string to just upper case letters and spaces, discarding punctuation marks, numbers, and other characters.\n",

    "An example of an encoding table is shown below. In this example we use `0` to denote a left child and `1` for a right child. This particular example _does not_ assume that space is the most frequency character.

If you are selected for a brief meeting, we'll spend about 15 minutes during the final exam slot to review your work. This interview will cover coding practices based on your past assignments. It is meant as a checkpoint to ensure that you have internalized the work you submitted.\n"
